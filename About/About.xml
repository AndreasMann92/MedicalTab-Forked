  <description>Adds a comprehensive medical overview tab, showing your colonists’ health at a glance. 

&lt;size=24&gt;Important&lt;/size&gt;
Does not require a new save game 
Can safely be enabled/disabled in ongoing saves. 

&lt;size=24&gt;Note&lt;/size&gt;
The medical tab was rebuild from the ground up for A17. That means many improvements, but possibly also some new bugs. Please let me know if you found any bugs, weird behaviours, or have a suggestion.

&lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;
Shows vital medical statistics for Colonists, Animals, Prisoners, Visitors and Hostiles*.
Medical care designation, including mass and default assignments
Overview of bleeding rates, pain and infection/disease/immunity progress
See efficiency on all capabilities
Schedule new operations and see planned operations
Sort by everything 

*: The hostile tab will by default only show downed hostiles, as I consider showing all hostiles cheating. There’s a toggle in the mod options to show all hostiles instead.

&lt;size=24&gt;Powered by Harmony&lt;/size&gt;
